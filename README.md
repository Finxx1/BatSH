# BatSH
Adds aliases for linux commands in windows, so that ```ls``` = ```dir```. Also works on linux too.
## What?
BatSH is a batch script that adds aliases for linux commands. For a list of programs, use ```batsh-help```.
## Why?
I used the linux terminal for too long and now I keep trying to use ```ls``` in Command Prompt. So I made this to fix it without breaking a habit.
## How?
The ```DOSKEY``` command is essentially the windows version of the ```alias``` command in bash.
